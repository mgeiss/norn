{"name":"Norn","tagline":"UDP Multicast based java remoting using RMI under the hood.","body":"Summary\r\n-------\r\nIn norse mythology the Norns are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and\r\nmen. They spin the thread of fate at the foot of Yggdrasil, the tree of the\r\nworld. For more information see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norns).\r\n\r\nThe approach of this project is to provide a simple java remoting cluster, that\r\nfeels like using RMI. It uses UDP multicast to find all RMI registry and connect\r\nto a Node using a simple load algorhythm.\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n------\r\nNorn has been written by Markus Geiss (mgeiss257@gmail.com).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nI've provided a JUnit testcase, so you can see how simple it is to use norn.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright 2012 Markus Geiss\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\nMaven\r\n-----\r\nTo use norn just add the follwing dependency to your local pom.xml:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>com.github.mgeiss</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>norn</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.1.1</version>\r\n    </dependency>","google":"UA-39629692-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
